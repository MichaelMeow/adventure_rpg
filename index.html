            <!-- Choose a companion -->
            <p>You find yourself in the town pub. You approach the barkeep and ask for a pint of grog. He passes you a frothy mug. You take a hefty swig. It helps, but it doesn’t heal the pain. You are mourning the loss of your true love. They were taken in the night. You know little of the mysterious circumstances surrounding their disappearance. The only clue you have is a piece of torn parchment that was left in their room. It is scribbled with a single word: Borf. You read the word aloud as you try to make sense of this tragedy.

            A man appears beside you and startles you from your lament. He is a large, disheveled bloke who reeks of alcohol. “Why do you speak the name of the Goblin King?” he slurs. With sadness and confusion in your eyes, you show him the parchment. “Borf is the most evil creature in the land. There is a bounty for his head,” he declares as he brandishes a sword. “I plan to capture him myself!”

            Another man overhears your conversation and interrupts. “No ordinary man stands a chance against the Goblin King,” he says. “He wields powers of darkness.” This character is a scholarly gentleman with an arm full of texts. “I’ve studied the ancient texts, and I know all about him. The key is his magic staff. I have developed a plan to acquire it.”

            At that moment, a flaming arrow comes crashing through the window of the pub and lands on your table. Chaos erupts in the bar and you have to make a run for it. Both of these men have knowledge of the Goblin King, who may have had something to do with the disappearance of your love. You have nothing left to lose, so you decide to find this Borf. Which of these two adventurers will you follow on your new quest: The drunk who seeks a bounty or the scholar who seeks knowledge?</p>

            <!-- Drunk Riddle -->
            <p>After a few more pints and shouting conversation the drunkard is finally ready to go. He picks up his giant frame and drags it away from the bar. You leave the pub with the drunkard by your side and embark on your adventure. He tells you once again that he will kill Borf and steal his treasure. He continues on at length about his plans to then buy a horse, to maybe buy a compass and to somehow attract a suitable partner. His motivations are simple and despite his intimidating demeanor he seems very good natured. He stops briefly beside the path to make sick in a bush.

            As you approach the edge of town, you encounter an old hag. She prolly has had a very rough life, or she's like 200 years old. It seems she is blocking the path, but not with her sack of bones. With no provocation she says: "Good evening travelers. My name is Vurda. If you cannot solve my riddle something bad will happen." She recites the riddle with boredom. It seems this is not her first riddle rodeo.

            "Lovely and round,
            I shine with pale light,
            grown in the darkness,
            A lady's delight."

            Which answer do you choose?</p>

            <!-- Scholar Riddle -->
            <p>You push through the panicked crowd as you hurry out of the pub in pursuit of the scholar. You barely make it out before the building erupts in flames. “Do you wish to join me on my quest?” the scholar asks. You nod. His knowledge could dispel the mystery of these tragic events. “Fantastic!” he exclaims. “These ancient scrolls tell of a castle in the forest where Borf resides. That is our destination.”

            Intrigued by this new discovery, you follow the scholar out of town and toward the forest. As you approach the drawbridge that leads out of town, you encounter an old hermit. “You may not pass unless you answer my riddle,” he says. You are in a hurry, but he seems harmless, so you agree.

            *Riddle*
            There are three apples and you take two. How many apples do you have?</p>

            <!-- Stats Test -->
            <p>You have answered the stupid riddle with the wrong choice. They seem equally viable but this old hag, er, Vurda only accepts the answer "Pearls". She cackles, as she would, and tells you that her big brother Borf will be delighted she prevented you from leaving town. At this point you realize you don't know the name of the drunkard. You have spent a few hours conversing about fate and it's cruel tricks; about life and the dreams you have. You have made a true friend that has a shared interest in defeating Borf. If you survive this encounter with Vurda (whomst'nt name no one needs to know ever, whomst've is a damned goblin related to Borf) you should maybe introduce yourself??
            Well, I guess you need to push this old hag/goblin aside and continue on your journey, eh? You do so with ease and hear her mumbling something behind you. Shoot! She has cast a spell! (More cackles.) If you fail this charisma stat test your fate will be even less fortunate than usual lol.</p>
