            <!-- Drunk Riddle -->
            <p class="hidden">After a few more pints and shouting conversation the drunkard is finally ready to go. He picks up his giant frame and drags it away from the bar. You leave the pub with the drunkard by your side and embark on your adventure. He tells you once again that he will kill Borf and steal his treasure. He continues on at length about his plans to then buy a horse, to maybe buy a compass and to somehow attract a suitable partner. His motivations are simple and despite his intimidating demeanor he seems very good natured. He stops briefly beside the path to make sick in a bush.

              As you approach the edge of town, you encounter an old hag. She prolly has had a very rough life, or she's like 200 years old. It seems she is blocking the path, but not with her sack of bones. With no provocation she says: "Good evening travelers. My name is Vurda. If you cannot solve my riddle something bad will happen." She recites the riddle with boredom. It seems this is not her first riddle rodeo.
              "Lovely and round,
              I shine with pale light,
              grown in the darkness,
              A lady's delight."

            <p class="hidden">You push through the panicked crowd as you hurry out of the pub in pursuit of the scholar. You barely make it out before the building erupts in flames. “Do you wish to join me on my quest?” the scholar asks. You nod. His knowledge could dispel the mystery of these tragic events. “Fantastic!” he exclaims. “These ancient scrolls tell of a castle in the forest where Borf resides. That is our destination.”

                Intrigued by this new discovery, you follow the scholar out of town and toward the forest. As you approach the drawbridge that leads out of town, you encounter an old hermit. He is hunched over and draped in a dark cloak. “You may not pass unless you answer my riddle,” he says. You are in a hurry, but he seems harmless, so you agree.

                *Riddle*

            <p class="hidden">You have answered the stupid riddle with the wrong choice. They seem equally viable but this old hag, er, Vurda only accepts the answer "Pearls". She cackles, as she would, and tells you that her big brother Borf will be delighted she prevented you from leaving town. At this point you realize you don't know the name of the drunkard. You have spent a few hours conversing about fate and it's cruel tricks; about life and the dreams you have. You have made a true friend that has a shared interest in defeating Borf. If you survive this encounter with Vurda (whomst'nt name no one needs to know ever, whomst've is a damned goblin related to Borf) you should maybe introduce yourself??
              Well, I guess you need to push this old hag/goblin aside and continue on your journey, eh? You do so with ease and hear her mumbling something behind you. Shoot! She has cast a spell! (More cackles.) If you fail this charisma stat test your fate will be even less fortunate than usual lol.</p>

Bootstrap doesn’t seem bothered by it at all. A moat flows around the castle, but instead of water a brown sewage burbles slowly. Bootstrap pushes a branch out of the way to reveal a path to a large brown, stone chute emptying into the moat from underneath the castle where the sun dost ne'er shineth.
                “It’s our only way in,” Bootstrap tells you, as if he’s been here before. You’ve heard tales of the diseased phantoms of goblin excrement, as putrid and potent as poison. Bootstrap dips his flask in it, and you don’t even want to imagine why. 

                You think you may see another way. If you monkey climb across the beam under the drawbridge and swing up onto that stone there that seems to be poking out a bit, a small window on the other side could just barely fit your broad shoulders.

Bootstrap licks his hairy lips which makes bile creep up your throat. But your lost love is all that’s on your mind. 

                The goblin looks up dumbly from his game. You must think quickly. What will you do? 

                You could run past him, but he's blocking the way.

                You could hide, but unless he's really as stupid as he looks he's probably seen you. 

                You could talk to him and try to convince him you're goblins.

Artemesia ties a perfumed kerchief round his nose parts. A moat flows around the castle, but instead of water a brown sewage burbles slowly. Artemesia pushes a branch out of the way to reveal a path to a large brown, stone chute emptying into the moat from underneath the castle where the sun dost ne'er shineth.  
                “It’s our only way in,” Artemesia tells you, as if he’s been here before. You’ve heard tales of the diseased phantoms of goblin excrement, as putrid and potent as poison. Artemesia saves a phial of the noxious sludge, perhaps to add to a potion in his alchemical laboratory.  
                You think you may see another way. If you monkey climb across the beam under the drawbridge and swing up onto that stone that seems to be poking out a bit, a small window on the other side could just barely fit your broad shoulders.

              <p class="hidden">You and Artemesia emerge from the forest in full Goblin Armor and smeared with waste and dried blood, but even with the accoutrement you make a scrawny excuse for goblins. 

              An invisible cloud of stench leads you down the road to the Goblin King Borf’s Castle, erupting out of the landscape like a pimple.  
              The castle's drawbridge is down. A single goblin guard is playing checkers against himself. A fly becomes trapped in his ear wax. The goblin reaches up and pulls a few flies from his ear gunk and tosses 'em in his mouth like caramel corn. 

              Artemesia makes a sound of pain, as though he has seen something his huge brain will never let him forget. 

              The goblin looks up dumbly from his game. You must think quickly. What will you do?  
              You could run past him, but he's blocking the way.  
              You could fight him, but he looks quite strong.  
              You could hide, but unless he's really as stupid as he looks he's probably seen you.  
              You could talk to him and try to convince him you're goblins.  
              Or you could just walk by casually as if your confidence alone could fool him. 

              Artemesia’s judgmental eyes wait for your stupid decision.</p>

              <p class="hidden">You have defeated the terrible Goblin King Borf. His gross behavior can no longer unleash terror upon the earth. He manages to utter one last menacing threat: "You haven't seen the last of me..." and then hands you a glamor shot of his likeness and expires. His foul plan to resurrect Jaime and open the doors to the underworld will die with him... so it would seem.
              Artemisia snatches up the magic staff. He turns to you and with a wry smile says "Hey, buddy. Thanks for helping me acquire the magic staff. I'm going to kill you and resurrect Jaime myself. With your undead lost lover by my side I will complete the ritual to open the doors to the underworld and unleash unknown horrors upon the earth. I'm not a goblin but I promise you I can be an excellent Goblin King!!! Now you die!"
              Artemisia attempts to cast a fireball but instead the magic staff lobs a glob of ranch dressing at you. That's where that stuff comes from!? You have been covered in cool ranch dressing. Attack Artemisia or fling ranch dressing at them?</p>

              <p class="hidden">You attack and kill Artemisia with ease! You are truly the stuff heroes are made of.
                Tear in eye you take one last look at Jaime Jquiria. They would have made a lovely undead Goblin Royalty. They made a wonderful normal alive-human-true-love partner. Alas, that ship has sailed.
                You gather a small fortune in treasure and light the castle on fire as you leave. Tossing Borf's glamor shot in the fire you laugh out loud. The hero's journey has many branches and you have walked the path to victory. Fortune smiles upon thee. <3 </p>
