The stranger on the right is a scholarly looking gent that has a witty tongue. You need a companion to continue your journey and find both of these characters worthy.

            After a few more pints and shouting conversation the drunkard is finally ready to go. He picks up his giant frame and drags it away from the bar. You leave the pub with the drunkard by your side and embark on your adventure. He tells you once again that he will kill Borf and steal his treasure. He continues on at length about his plans to then buy a horse, to maybe buy a compass and to somehow attract a suitable partner. His motivations are simple and despite his intimidating demeanor he seems very good natured. He stops briefly beside the path to make sick in a bush.
            As you approach the edge of town, you encounter an old hag. She prolly has had a very rough life, or she's like 200 years old. It seems she is blocking the path, but not with her sack of bones. With no provocation she says: "Good evening travelers. My name is Vurda. If you cannot solve my riddle something bad will happen." She recites the riddle with boredom. It seems this is not her first riddle rodeo.
            "Lovely and round,
            I shine with pale light,
            grown in the darkness,
            A lady's delight."
            Answers:
            A. Pearl (right). B. Moon (wrong). Which answer do you choose?</p>

            <p>You leave the pub behind with the scholar by your side and embark on your adventure. On the way out of town you encounter an old hermit. He asks you to solve a riddle. Which answer do you choose?</p>

            <!-- Stats Test -->
            <p>You have answered the stupid riddle with the wrong choice. They seem equally viable but this old hag, er, Vurda only accepts the answer "Pearls". She cackles, as she would, and tells you that her big brother Borf will be delighted she prevented you from leaving town. At this point you realize you don't know the name of the drunkard. You have spent a few hours conversing about fate and it's cruel tricks; about life and the dreams you have. You have made a true friend that has a shared interest in defeating Borf. If you survive this encounter with Vurda (whomst'nt name no one needs to know ever, whomst've is a damned goblin related to Borf) you should maybe introduce yourself??
            Well, I guess you need to push this old hag/goblin aside and continue on your journey, eh? You do so with ease and hear her mumbling something behind you. Shoot! She has cast a spell! (More cackles.) If you fail this charisma stat test your fate will be even less fortunate than usual lol.</p>

With the lights low and the curtains open you fear you may be on the verge of just blowing it. <br>
                You look around the room and notice your dead lover Jaime on a ritual table. Enraged, you find the strength to push forward.

                Tear in eye you take one last look at Jaime Jquiria. They would have made a lovely undead Goblin Royalty. They made a wonderful normal-alive-human-true-love partner. Alas, that ship has sailed. <br>
                You gather a small fortune in treasure and light the castle on fire as you leave. Tossing Borf's glamor shot in the fire you laugh out loud. The hero's journey has many branches and you have walked the path to victory. Fortune smiles upon thee. <3</p>

                <p>You have defeated the terrible Goblin King Borf. His gross behavior can no longer unleash terror upon the earth. He manages to utter one last menacing threat: "You haven't seen the last of me..." and then hands you a glamor shot of his likeness and expires. His foul plan to resurrect Jaime and open the doors to the underworld will die with him... so it would seem. <br>
                Artemisia snatches up the magic staff. He turns to you and with a wry smile says "Hey, buddy. Thanks for helping me acquire the magic staff. I'm going to kill you and resurrect Jaime myself. With your undead lost lover by my side I will complete the ritual to open the doors to the underworld and unleash unknown horrors upon the earth. I'm not a goblin but I promise you I can be an excellent Goblin King!!! Now you die!" <br>
                Artemisia attempts to cast a fireball but instead the magic staff lobs a glob of ranch dressing at you. That's where that stuff comes from!? You have been covered in cool ranch dressing. Attack Artemisia or fling ranch dressing at them?</p>

                <p>You scoop a handful of cool ranch dressing from your face and hurl it at your worthy adversary. Artemisia is hit in the face with cool ranch dressing and is confused. <!--go to -page-11--></p>

                <p>You attack and kill Artemisia with ease! You are truly the stuff heroes are made of. <br>
                Tear in eye you take one last look at Jaime Jquiria. They would have made a lovely undead Goblin Royalty. They made a wonderful normal alive-human-true-love partner. Alas, that ship has sailed.<br>
                You gather a small fortune in treasure and light the castle on fire as you leave. Tossing Borf's glamor shot in the fire you laugh out loud. The hero's journey has many branches and you have walked the path to victory. Fortune smiles upon thee. <3</p> <br>
